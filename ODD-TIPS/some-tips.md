## NetworkManger show connections via cli
```bash
 nmcli connection show
```

## Setting up git
```bash
git config --global user.email "kingtolga@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "Tolga Erok"
```
## Setting up zram Ubunut/Deb
Step 1
Note: run all the commands below in the terminal, copying them one line at a time and hitting enter. Make sure they are copied correctly.

First check if you have a swap file by running free -h. If you do have a swap file, continue to the next step. Otherwise run the code below.
```bash
sudo su 
fallocate -l 4G /swapfile 
chmod 600 /swapfile 
mkswap /swapfile 
swapon /swapfile 
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | tee -a /etc/fstab
```
Step 2
Run 
```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub 
```
and edit the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT to read:
```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash zswap.enabled=1 zswap.compressor=lz4 zswap.max_pool_percent=50 zswap.zpool=z3fold"
```
What does the max pool percent variable mean? This refers to the maximum % of your RAM that will be taken up with compressed storage. It is dynamically allocated, so it doesnâ€™t take up any space until you actually start using it. For most systems, 50% is a good maximum. For really low memory systems, you can try 70%. Anything higher will make the system unusably slow (Google has actually benchmarked this for Chrome OS).

Save your changes (type Ctrl+X and type y and then enter). Now run:
```bash
sudo update-grub
```
Step 3
Run the following:
```bash
sudo su
echo lz4 >> /etc/initramfs-tools/modules 
echo lz4_compress >> /etc/initramfs-tools/modules 
echo z3fold >> /etc/initramfs-tools/modules 
update-initramfs -u
```
You are done! Reboot and run 
```bash
cat /sys/module/zswap/parameters/enabled
```
If zswap is working, you should see a Y printed.
